This works fine with php and html pages, If you want to track the html pages you will have to add following to your .htaccess file

AddType application/x-httpd-php .html .htm

if you are using php5 then include this

AddType application/x-httpd-php5 .html .htm

and if either of this don't work then you will have to rename your html file to php.
